# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository!  
Here I share my journey solving algorithmic problems on LeetCode, uploading clean, well-commented solutions with explanations.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Each file/folder is named after the **LeetCode problem number** (e.g., `121`).
- Use the “Go to File” feature on GitHub to quickly find a specific solution by problem number.
- Each solution includes:
  - The **code** in C++.
  - Clear **comments and explanations** to help understand the approach.
  - Sometimes, multiple approaches (brute force, optimal, etc.).

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

- Well-organized, easy-to-follow solutions.
- Both **optimal** and **brute-force** methods where relevant.
- Notes on **time and space complexity**.
- Helpful for beginners and intermediate programmers learning algorithms.

## 📈 Why This Repo?

- Track my progress on LeetCode.
- Build a personal reference of solutions.
- Share knowledge with the coding community.


**Happy Coding!** ✨
